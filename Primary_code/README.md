# HHS Staffing Plan Analysis

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the HHS (Health and Human Services) staffing plan dataset to identify staffing patterns and predict the total number of staff involved across various HHS agencies. 
## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach that includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparation of the dataset for analysis, including the removal of irrelevant features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Application of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to predict the total staff involved. Models are evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Conducting a comparative analysis of the models to identify the most effective approach for the given dataset.

## Experimental Design
The project employs cross-validation as part of the experimental design to ensure the models' performance is robust and reliable across different subsets of the data.

## Repository Contents
This GitHub repository includes the following:
- **README.md**: Outlining the project's objectives, methodology, experimental design, and repository contents.
- **Technical Reports**: Provided in Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB) format, detailing the analysis process, model training and evaluation, and synthetic data generation steps.
- **Compiled Report**: A compiled version of the technical reports available in PDF format, offering a comprehensive overview of the project findings and methodologies.
- **Dataset**: The working dataset used in the analysis. Due to data privacy and accessibility considerations, a link to the dataset is provided for reference.

## Dataset
The dataset includes staffing numbers across various HHS agencies without missing values. It is structured to facilitate regression analysis aimed at predicting the total staff involved.

## Models Considered
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Conclusions
The project provides valuable insights into HHS staffing patterns and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting staffing levels. 

## Future Work
Further exploration of advanced synthetic data generation techniques and additional model tuning could be conducted to improve the analysis and predictions.
