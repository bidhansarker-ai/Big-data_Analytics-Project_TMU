# HHS Staffing Plan Analysis

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to examine the HHS (Health and Human Services) staffing plan dataset. The objective is to uncover staffing patterns within different HHS agencies and accurately predict the total staff count involved across these agencies.
## Methodology
The project adheres to a systematic methodology, comprising the following stages:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Priming the dataset for analysis by eliminating extraneous features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Employing Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to forecast the total staff engaged. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score gauge model performance.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Undertaking a comparative assessment of the models to ascertain the optimal approach tailored to the dataset.

## Experimental Design
As part of the experimental design, the project utilizes cross-validation to ascertain the robustness and reliability of the models' performance across various subsets of the data.

## Repository Contents
This GitHub repository includes the following:
- **README.md**: Outlining the project's objectives, methodology, experimental design, and repository contents.
- **Technical Reports**: Provided in Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB) format, detailing the analysis process, model training and evaluation, and synthetic data generation steps.
- **Compiled Report**: A compiled version of the technical reports available in PDF format, offering a comprehensive overview of the project findings and methodologies.
- **Dataset**: The working dataset used in the analysis. Due to data privacy and accessibility considerations, a link to the dataset is provided for reference.

## Dataset
The dataset includes staffing numbers across various HHS agencies without missing values. It is structured to facilitate regression analysis aimed at predicting the total staff involved.

## Models Considered
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Conclusions
The project provides valuable insights into HHS staffing patterns and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting staffing levels. 

## Future Work
Further exploration of advanced synthetic data generation techniques and additional model tuning could be conducted to improve the analysis and predictions.
